<!--{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further //your learning.}-->
I am in the process of learning React Native. I have hard that it is easier to do a Notes Application. 

<!--//{Provide a description of your app.  Describe how to use the app.}-->
My app has one main page with that holds a list of all of my notes, and it list has a link that lead to another page with the actual note.

The purpose of this app is to learn how to use React Native. This was the first step for me to create a language note application for missionaries or for anyone that wants to learn a new language and keep notes on what they have learned. 

<!--//{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}-->
